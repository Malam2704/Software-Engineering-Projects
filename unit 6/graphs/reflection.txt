I elarned today about Grpahs and it's vertices
where each Vertice can be connected directly, or the arrow,
or indirectly or without the arrow

I wish I knew hwo to get up early on time, btu seriously
I wish I didn't get lost

I want to know exactly why we need to make new vertices
each time we make an indirected or undirected connection
