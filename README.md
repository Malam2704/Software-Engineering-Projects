# Software-Engineering-Projects

Here are my Second Semester Software Engineer class training files. Where I have gone through various tpoics such as implementing changiges so I get more used to Java from Python.
  - Data Structures: Queses, Lists, Binary Trees, Nodes, Graphs
  - Class Structure and Parent-Child heirarchies
  - Junit Library and Test Driven Development Frameworks
  - Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals (Java, C) 
  - Scripting Programaing Fundamentals (Python, JS)
  - A few tests I've recevied good scores within (practicums), whcih show case my experience with Software Development Fundamentals

Projects Here: 

 - Advanced Math Calculator: I had to complete tedious amounts of Discrete Math problems, but all the other webpages were buggy and filled with ads, and I answer these questions in my free time with my chromebook, not at my desktop. These features & extensiosn slow my computer so I needed a bsic calcualtor with all necesarry fucntionalities, but without any useless add-ons, so I decided to just make one. Using JavaScript in an Object Oriented Programming style, I created an interface with HTML/CSS to solve these Math problems.
  - Peg Game: Made with Java, where a user can solve a board. I used inheritance principles with various classes running multiple threads. Principles of Object Oriented       programming were used along with Test Driven Development for the classes. I used Javaâ€™s filereader and scanner to make various boards with given files, and used various abstract data types.
