# Software-Engineering-Projects

Here are my Second Semester Software Engineer class training files. Where I have gone through various tpoics such as implementing changiges so I get more used to Java from Python.
  - Data Structures: Queses, Lists, Binary Trees, Nodes, Graphs
  - Class Structure and Parent-Child heirarchies
  - Junit Library and Test Driven Development Frameworks
  - Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals (Java, C) 
  - Scripting Programaing Fundamentals (Python, JS)
  - A few tests I've recevied good scores within (practicums), whcih show case my experience with Software Development Fundamentals

Projects Here: 
  - Peg Game: Made with Java, where a user can solve a board. I used inheritance principles with various classes running multiple threads. Principles of Object Oriented       programming were used along with Test Driven Development for the classes. I used Java’s filereader and scanner to make various boards with given files, and used various abstract data types.
  - Advanced Math Calculator: I had to complete tedious amounts of Calculus problems, so using Python’s Object Oriented Programming and Math Libraries, created an interface to solve calculus level problems such as Limits & Series.
